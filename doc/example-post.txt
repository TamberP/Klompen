This is an example post for Klompen. Above this text in the source
file is the metadata header (Everything before --text follows this
line--), with various pieces of information about this post.

Everything from the metadata-end line is the post itself, in Markdown
formatting; which is transformed into your blog output. The post ID
(ID in the metadata header) is meant to be a unique identifier for
each post; if a later post has the same ID, the earlier output is
overwritten.

## TODO

* ID autogeneration + writeback
* [DONE 2011-11-13]Automatic output folder creation
* Date parsing
  - Multiple date lines, one for each time an edit is made?
* Default tags
* Archive pages
  - Monthly archives ($outputdir/archives/$year/$month/index{,2,3,etc}.htm)
  - Yearly archives  ($outputdir/archives/$year/index.htm)
  - Tag archives     ($outputdir/archives/$tag/index.htm)
* An emacs mode (Like weblogger.el?) for easy page adding, updating,
  etc. (This could be used to automatically add IDs to pages?)
