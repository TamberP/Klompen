# Klompen

Klompen is a static blog generation engine, with an ever growing tower
of dependencies.

## Dependencies
   - HTML::Tiny
   - JSON
   - File::Path
   - File::Slurp
   - Text::Markdown
   - XML::RSS::SimpleGen

## Configuration

Configuration is per-blog, with the settings pulled from klompen.cfg;
a mostly self-explanatory JSON file with the following sections:

### posts

* **extension**: the file extension to use on the output files
* **output_dir**: Directory to create the output files in. **must already exist**
* **source_dir**: Directory that will be searched for source files. (*.txt)
* **stylesheet**: URL of the stylesheet you want to use.

### links

This part of the config is an array of links, which will be added to
the 'links' section of the output page's sidebar.

## Using

To use Klompen, one writes one's posts in the source directory; in
plain-text (UTF-8, preferably), using the header to provide
information such as the post's title, date of publication, the list of
tags/categories (comma separated) and the post's ID (This line will be
automatically added, if it is not manually inserted. However, one can
control the post's ID by setting it manually, which may be useful to
some users.)

Please see the article template (doc/article_template) for the header.

Then, when one wants to publish/update one's posts; run ./klompen
(After modifying the configuration to point to your posts' source
directory, and the directory you wish to output to, of course.)  and
every post in the source directory will be converted into a HTML page
in the output directory.
